# Celebrity Chat Bot

Celebrity chat bot asks the user a number of questions, and then assigns them a celebrity soulmate based on their responses.

The assignment was to create a chatbot that would promt the user for some information, then use that information to determine a bot reply. The questions were asked in a number of different ways (via text input, buttons or drop-down menus).

## The problem

### Approach to the problem
We first looked at the example chat bot provided by Technigo and discussed to ourselves how the code was written. We then looked at the iteration instructions provided and followed them. 

### Tools and Techniques
Our group used [Sketchboard](https://sketchboard.io/) to map out how the flow of the project will be. Using a visual guide made us keep track of what we are doing and stick to the plan in order to finish the project. 

### Future Improvements
We would like to remove the event listener in order to prevent users from clicking the buttons and getting more than one answer from our questions. We would also want to refactor our code if we have more time. Other than this, we think our project is fully functional.
